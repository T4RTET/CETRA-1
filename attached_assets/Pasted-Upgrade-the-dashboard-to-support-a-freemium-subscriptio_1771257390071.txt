Upgrade the dashboard to support a freemium subscription model with soft paywall logic.

Do NOT block access to the dashboard.
Users must be able to explore the UI and build workflows, but execution should be locked behind a subscription.

Implement the following behavior:

⸻

FREE PLAN RULES

Users on the Free plan can:

• Access dashboard
• Use workflow builder
• Create and save workflows
• Configure cards and settings
• View analytics
• Simulate workflows

Users on the Free plan cannot:

• Run real automation
• Execute multi-account workflows
• Use advanced execution features

⸻

EXECUTION PAYWALL

When a Free user clicks:

“Run”, “Start automation”, or any execution button

Show a modal popup:

Title:
Unlock execution

Text:
Upgrade your plan to run real automations and scale workflows.

Buttons:
→ Upgrade plan (primary glowing button)
→ Continue in free mode (secondary, closes modal)

Free mode continues to allow simulation only.

Do NOT allow execution unless user upgrades.

⸻

FREE PLAN STATUS BANNER

At the top of dashboard add a small non-intrusive banner:

“You are on Free Plan — upgrade to run automations”

Include a small upgrade button.

This banner should be visible but not aggressive.

⸻

LOCKED FEATURES UI

Add lock icons to premium features:

• Multi-account execution
• Smart routing
• Advanced scheduling
• Priority execution

When user clicks locked feature:

Open upgrade modal instead of executing action.

⸻

UPGRADE MODAL STYLE

Dark glassmorphism modal
Centered
Smooth fade animation
Premium neon accent

Modal should feel like a SaaS upsell, not an error.

⸻

OPTIONAL: FREE TRIAL EXECUTIONS

Allow 3 real executions for Free users.

After the 3rd run:

Force upgrade modal.

Track this count per user in backend state.

⸻

UX GOAL

User should:

• Explore product freely
• Build workflows
• Feel invested
• Hit paywall only when trying to execute

No aggressive blocking.
Monetization happens at the moment of intent.
