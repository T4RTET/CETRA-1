Inside the existing Cetra dashboard, implement the page that opens when the user clicks the left sidebar tab:

👉 “Workflow Builder”

This is NOT a standalone app.
It must be a page inside the dashboard layout.

Use the current dashboard shell:
left sidebar + top header + main content area.

Tech stack:
Node.js backend
HTML + CSS + vanilla JS frontend
No frameworks
Modular JS structure
