Extend the existing dashboard system.
Do NOT rewrite current logic.
Add features on top of current tranche/account system.

⸻

1. User-defined account groups (custom tranches)

Allow users to manually create and manage their own account groups.

Rename internal concept:

System tranche = execution batch
User group = logical account grouping

User groups must persist independently from execution tranches.

⸻

Group management UI

Add new section inside dashboard:

“Account Groups”

User can:

• create group
• rename group
• delete group
• drag accounts into group
• multi-select accounts
• move accounts between groups

Each account can belong to only one active group.

Show group cards:

Group name
number of accounts
last activity
status indicator

⸻

Workflow Builder integration

User groups must automatically appear in Workflow Builder.

When building a workflow:

User can assign workflow to:

• specific group
• multiple groups
• all accounts

Example:

Workflow A → Group 1
Workflow B → Group 2 + Group 3

UI:

Group selector dropdown inside workflow card.

Workflow execution respects group assignment.

⸻

Execution mapping

When a workflow runs:

System automatically creates execution tranches
based on selected group.

Group = logical filter
Tranche = runtime batch

Do not mix concepts visually.

User sees:

Group → contains accounts
Execution → runs inside group

⸻

Group overview stats

Each group dashboard card shows:

Success / Partial / Failed
last run time
active workflows
account count

Click group → opens group detail page.

⸻

2. Multi-language dashboard support

Add internationalization layer.

Supported languages:

• English (default)
• Russian
• Ukrainian
• Spanish
• Korean
• French

⸻

Language system behavior

Add language selector in top right corner:

Dropdown with flag + language name.

Language change must:

• update UI instantly
• persist in user profile
• persist in local storage
• apply after reload

⸻

Translation architecture

All UI text must be moved to language files:

/i18n/en.json
/i18n/ru.json
/i18n/ua.json
/i18n/es.json
/i18n/kr.json
/i18n/fr.json

No hardcoded strings in components.

Use key-based lookup system.

Example:

t(“dashboard.title”)

⸻

Translation coverage

Translate:

Dashboard
Workflow Builder
Subscription
Referrals
Settings
Group system
Errors
Buttons
Status labels
Tooltips
Notifications

Everything user-facing.

⸻

Fallback logic

If translation key missing:

fallback to English.

No broken UI allowed.

⸻

Performance requirement

Language switching must not reload entire app.
Only rerender UI text.
