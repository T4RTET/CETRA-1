I need to implement a first-time user onboarding tour inside the dashboard.

When a user enters the dashboard for the first time, a guided tutorial with arrows and tooltips must appear.

⸻

🎯 Goal

Create a step-by-step interactive walkthrough that:
 • Highlights UI elements
 • Shows explanatory tooltips
 • Uses animated arrows
 • Guides the user through the main features
 • Runs only on first visit

⸻

✅ Core Requirements

1️⃣ Trigger Logic
 • Show onboarding only if:
localStorage key “dashboardTourCompleted” is NOT set
 • After completion:
set localStorage “dashboardTourCompleted” = true
 • Add button in Settings → “Replay Tutorial”

⸻

2️⃣ Visual Behavior

Each step must:
 • Highlight target element (glow or overlay)
 • Dim background (semi-transparent overlay)
 • Show tooltip near element
 • Display animated arrow pointing to element
 • Show step indicator (e.g., 1/6)
 • Include buttons:
 • Next
 • Back
 • Skip
 • Finish (on last step)

⸻

3️⃣ Suggested Steps

Example onboarding flow:
 1. Sidebar navigation
→ Explain main navigation
 2. Workflow Builder
→ Explain how to create automation
 3. Templates section
→ Explain prebuilt templates
 4. Referrals
→ Explain credit system
 5. Settings
→ Explain personalization
 6. Profile / Subscription area
→ Explain plan management

Make steps configurable via JSON so they can be edited later.

⸻

4️⃣ Technical Implementation
 • Use portal rendering for tooltip layer
 • Overlay must cover entire screen
 • Tooltip must auto-position (top/bottom/left/right based on space)
 • Smooth fade transitions
 • Prevent scrolling during onboarding
 • Ensure it works with dark/light theme
 • Ensure it works on responsive layout

⸻

5️⃣ Edge Cases
 • If target element is not mounted → wait until available
 • If sidebar collapsed → auto-open it
 • If user clicks outside → do not break flow
 • If window resized → recalculate tooltip position

⸻

6️⃣ UX Quality Requirements
 • Modern minimal tooltip style
 • Soft shadow
 • Rounded corners
 • Subtle arrow animation (pulse effect)
 • No flickering
 • No layout shift

⸻

7️⃣ Expected Result

First time user enters dashboard →
Screen slightly dims →
Arrow appears →
Tooltip explains first feature →
User clicks Next →
Guided through entire interface →
On finish → tour never shows again (unless manually replayed).

⸻

If needed, refactor dashboard structure to support stable element targeting using data attributes like:

data-tour=“workflow-builder”
