I need to implement an additional guided tour specifically for the Card Settings panel inside the Workflow Builder.

This tour must explain what each settings section does and how to configure a card properly.

This is separate from the main builder tour.

⸻

🎯 Goal

When user opens a card for the first time (or clicks “Help inside card”),
show contextual arrows and tooltips explaining:
 • What the card does
 • What each settings category controls
 • What Basic vs Advanced mode means
 • What required fields are
 • What delays / retries do
 • What execution behavior means

⸻

🧠 Trigger Logic
 • Show this tour when:
localStorage key “cardSettingsTourCompleted” is NOT set
OR user clicks “Help” icon inside settings panel
 • After finishing:
set “cardSettingsTourCompleted” = true

⸻

🗂️ Required Tour Steps

Step 1 — Card Title / Type

Target: Card header
Explain:
 • This is the type of action this card performs
 • It defines what the automation step does
 • Changing card type resets configuration

⸻

Step 2 — Basic Settings Section

Target: Basic settings accordion
Explain:
 • These are required core parameters
 • Without these, the card cannot execute
 • Keep configuration minimal for simple workflows

⸻

Step 3 — Input Fields

Target: First input field
Explain:
 • This is a required parameter
 • Must be valid for execution
 • Some fields support variables or dynamic values

If validation exists → mention validation rules.

⸻

Step 4 — Delay Settings

Target: Delay field
Explain:
 • Delay controls when the action executes
 • Helps simulate natural behavior
 • Useful for automation timing control

⸻

Step 5 — Retry Logic

Target: Retry settings
Explain:
 • Retry defines how many times system reattempts on failure
 • Prevents workflow interruption
 • Higher retries may increase execution time

⸻

Step 6 — Advanced Mode Toggle

Target: Advanced Mode
Explain:
 • Enables extended configuration
 • Includes hidden technical parameters
 • Recommended only for experienced users

When toggled during tour → briefly show expanded options.

⸻

Step 7 — Execution Behavior

Target: Execution type (if exists)
Explain:
 • Defines whether action is sequential / parallel / conditional
 • Affects overall workflow logic

⸻

Step 8 — Save / Apply Changes

Target: Apply button
Explain:
 • Changes are not active until saved
 • Always confirm configuration before running workflow

⸻

🎨 UI Requirements
 • Panel-only overlay (do NOT dim entire builder)
 • Highlight only settings panel
 • Arrow pointing to exact field
 • Smooth transitions between steps
 • Step counter (1 / X)
 • Back / Next / Skip / Finish buttons
 • Close if user clicks outside panel

⸻

⚙️ Technical Requirements
 • Must dynamically detect visible settings (Basic vs Advanced)
 • If accordion collapsed → auto-expand during tour
 • If Advanced disabled → auto-enable temporarily
 • Recalculate tooltip position if panel scrolls
 • Prevent settings modification while tour active (optional but recommended)

Use data attributes like:

data-tour=“card-header”
data-tour=“basic-settings”
data-tour=“input-field”
data-tour=“delay-setting”
data-tour=“retry-setting”
data-tour=“advanced-toggle”
data-tour=“execution-mode”
data-tour=“apply-button”

⸻

📦 Architecture

Steps must be JSON-driven:

const cardSettingsTour = [
{
target: “card-header”,
title: “Action Type”,
description: “This defines what this card does.”
}
]

This allows easy updates later.

⸻

🚫 Avoid
 • Layout shifts
 • Scrolling the entire page
 • Breaking builder drag logic
 • Tooltip flickering
 • Overlay blocking panel width incorrectly

⸻

🎯 Expected Result

User opens card →
Settings panel opens →
Arrow highlights header →
Explains what card does →
Guides user through all configuration options →
