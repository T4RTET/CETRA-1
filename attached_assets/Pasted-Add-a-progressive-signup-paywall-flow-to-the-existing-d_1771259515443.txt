Add a progressive signup + paywall flow to the existing dashboard without breaking current UI.

Goal:
Users can explore and build workflows without an account, but must register to save and subscribe to run execution.

⸻

1. GUEST MODE

Implement guest mode:

• Allow users to open dashboard without login
• Allow creating workflows in memory (temporary state)
• Mark session as “Guest” in UI (top bar small badge)

Guest limitations:

• Cannot save workflows permanently
• Cannot run execution
• Data is stored only in local session

⸻

2. SIGNUP TRIGGER (PROGRESSIVE SIGNUP)

When guest clicks:

• Save workflow
OR
• Export workflow
OR
• Leave dashboard with unsaved changes

Show modal:

Title: Create free account
Text: Save your workflows and access them anytime
Buttons:
→ Continue with Google
→ Sign up with Email
→ Cancel

Important:

• After signup → automatically save workflow
• Do NOT lose user progress
• Smooth modal animation
• Dark theme matching dashboard

⸻

3. PAYWALL TRIGGER

When user clicks:

• Run workflow
• Schedule automation
• Cloud execution features

If user has no subscription:

Show paywall modal:

Title: Upgrade to run automation
Text: Execution requires an active subscription
Buttons:
→ View plans
→ Start free trial (if enabled)
→ Cancel

Modal should link to Subscription page.

⸻

4. UX DETAILS

Add:

• Soft blur background when modal opens
• No page reload
• Smooth transitions
• Preserve workflow state always

Guest banner in dashboard top:

“You are in Guest Mode — create an account to save your work”

Small dismissible info bar.

⸻

5. DATA SAFETY

Important behavior:

• Guest workflows stored in localStorage/session
• After signup → migrate guest workflows to user account
• No data loss allowed

⸻

6. OPTIONAL (if easy)

Add small onboarding tooltip:

Step 1: Build workflow
Step 2: Save
Step 3: Run automation

Only show first visit.

⸻

End result:

User can explore freely
Signup feels natural
Paywall appears only at execution moment
No friction early
No lost data
