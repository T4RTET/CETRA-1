Improve the existing workflow builder UI without rewriting the architecture.

1. Fix cursor bug

There is a cursor issue when dragging nodes:
the cursor becomes stuck or incorrect after drag.

Requirements:

• Cursor should be grab when hovering a node
• Cursor should be grabbing while dragging
• After drag ends → cursor resets to default
• No ghost cursor states
• No stuck pointer after release
• Dragging must feel smooth and native

Implement proper mouse event cleanup:

mousedown → dragging start
mousemove → dragging
mouseup → remove listeners

Ensure listeners are removed on mouseup and mouseleave.

Also prevent text selection while dragging:

user-select: none;

Only active during drag.

2. Visible connection lines between nodes

Currently connections are unclear or overlapping.

Add a clean visual connection system:

Requirements:

• Smooth curved lines between nodes (Bezier style)
• Neon blue glowing stroke
• Lines update in real-time while dragging
• No overlapping clutter
• Auto reroute if nodes move
• Lines stay readable on dark background

Style:

• Stroke gradient blue → purple
• Subtle glow
• 2px width
• Smooth animation on connect

Use SVG overlay layer:

<svg class="connection-layer"></svg>

Connections should:

• Attach to node anchor points
• Recalculate on node movement
• Avoid sharp angles
• Use cubic Bezier curves

Add hover effect:

• When hovering a line → highlight connection
• Slight glow increase

3. Improve connection logic

Each node should have:

• Input anchor (left)
• Output anchor (right)

Connections only allowed:

output → input

Prevent:

input → input
output → output

Add visual feedback:

• Anchor glows when connectable
• Invalid connection shows red flash

4. UX polish

Add:

• Smooth snapping when nodes align
• Grid background (subtle dots)
• Zoom + pan canvas support
• No jitter while dragging
• 60fps animations

⸻

Goal

The workflow board should feel like a professional node editor:

clean, readable, premium.
