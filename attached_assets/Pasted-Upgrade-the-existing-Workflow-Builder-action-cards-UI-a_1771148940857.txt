Upgrade the existing Workflow Builder action cards UI and logic.

DO NOT rebuild the entire system.
Modify the existing action card component.

Goal:
Each action card must have a clean basic mode + expandable advanced settings.

The default view should be simple and readable.
Advanced mode reveals power-user controls.
