Create a modern SaaS landing page for a crypto automation platform called “Cetra”.
Style: dark blue futuristic SaaS UI, premium, minimalistic, smooth gradients, glassmorphism accents, neon highlights.
The design should feel clean, high-tech, and trustworthy for crypto users.

IMPORTANT:
Add smooth scroll animations.
As the user scrolls, text should slide in softly from the top, and images/mockups should slide in from the right.
Animations must be subtle, smooth, premium, not flashy.
Use easing transitions and fade + motion reveal effects.
