Upgrade the existing workflow builder UI without rewriting the architecture.

Goal: expand card functionality and move all card configuration into a structured right-side settings panel with categorized menus and optional advanced mode.

⸻

1. Right-Side Unified Card Settings Panel

When a card is selected:
 • Open a persistent settings panel on the right
 • Remove inline settings inside cards
 • All configuration must live in this panel

The panel should contain collapsible categories:

Categories:

• Basic Settings
• Execution Logic
• Timing & Intervals
• Account Targeting
• Error Handling
• Advanced Settings

Each category must:
 • be collapsible
 • animate open/close smoothly
 • remember last opened state per session

Only Basic Settings should be expanded by default.

⸻

2. Advanced Settings Toggle

At the top of the panel add:

“Advanced Mode” toggle slider

Behavior:

OFF → show only essential settings
ON → reveal all advanced categories and fields

This toggle must:
 • animate reveal of hidden sections
 • not reload the card
 • not reset values
 • work instantly

Advanced mode is per user session, not per card.

⸻

3. New Functional Settings to Add

Add the following capabilities to cards:

• Website / target URL field
• Retry strategy selector
• Delay randomization range
• Execution priority
• Tranche/group selector
• Conditional execution rules
• Fail-safe stop toggle
• Logging level selector
• Max attempts limit
• Success confirmation rule
• Timeout behavior

Each of these must appear in logical categories.

⸻

4. UX Requirements
 • Settings panel scrollable with sticky header
 • Smooth hover and focus states
 • Dark futuristic dashboard style
 • Neon accent for active inputs
 • Tooltips for complex options
 • Input validation UI feedback
 • No layout shift when toggling categories

⸻

5. Card Interaction Behavior

Selecting a card:
 • highlights it
 • loads its settings in the panel
 • updates live when changed

Switching cards:
 • preserves previous card values
 • updates panel instantly
 • no re-render lag

⸻

6. Performance Constraints
 • Do not re-render the whole canvas
 • Only update selected card state
 • Keep transitions GPU-accelerated
 • Avoid heavy DOM rebuilds

⸻

7. Future-Proof Structure

Organize settings as:

card.config.basic
card.config.timing
card.config.execution
card.config.advanced

So new categories can be added later without UI rewrite.
