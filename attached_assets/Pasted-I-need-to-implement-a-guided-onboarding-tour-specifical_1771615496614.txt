I need to implement a guided onboarding tour specifically for the Workflow Builder interface.

This is NOT for the main dashboard — only for the constructor page.

The tour must explain:
 • What each area does
 • How cards work
 • How connections work
 • How settings panel works
 • What Advanced Mode does
 • How to save and run workflow

⸻

🎯 Goal

When user opens Workflow Builder for the first time, show a step-by-step interactive tour with arrows and contextual tooltips explaining:
 • Canvas
 • Cards (nodes)
 • Connections (edges)
 • Right settings panel
 • Template logic
 • Advanced toggle
 • Save / Run buttons

Tour must run only once unless manually restarted.

⸻

🧠 Trigger Logic
 • Check localStorage key: “builderTourCompleted”
 • If not set → run tour
 • On finish → set to true
 • Add button in builder header: “Replay Guide”

⸻

🗺️ Required Tour Steps (Exact Structure)

Step 1 — Canvas Area

Target: Main workflow canvas
Explain:
 • This is your workflow canvas
 • You can drag cards here
 • Move them freely
 • Zoom and navigate

⸻

Step 2 — Add Card Button

Target: Add Node / Add Block button
Explain:
 • Click here to add a new action card
 • Cards represent automation steps

⸻

Step 3 — Card (Node)

Target: One existing card
Explain:
 • Cards are actions
 • Each card can be configured
 • You can drag to reposition
 • Each card has connection points

Highlight:
 • Connection handles

⸻

Step 4 — Connections (Edges)

Target: Connection line between two cards
Explain:
 • Drag from output to input to create logic flow
 • Lines define execution order
 • Workflow runs top → bottom

Important:
Visually highlight edge clearly.

⸻

Step 5 — Right Settings Panel

Target: Right configuration panel
Explain:
 • All card settings appear here
 • Basic settings are visible by default
 • Settings are grouped by categories

⸻

Step 6 — Advanced Mode Toggle

Target: Advanced Mode switch
Explain:
 • Enable Advanced Mode to access extended parameters
 • Recommended for experienced users

⸻

Step 7 — Template Info (If template used)

Target: Template label or preset indicator
Explain:
 • This workflow was generated from template
 • You can modify any block
 • Save custom template anytime

⸻

Step 8 — Save & Run

Target: Save button
Explain:
 • Save workflow to your account

Target: Run button
Explain:
 • Start automation execution

⸻

🎨 UI Requirements
 • Full-screen dim overlay
 • Highlighted element with glow
 • Animated arrow pointing to element
 • Tooltip auto-positioning
 • Smooth fade transitions
 • Step counter (e.g., 3 / 8)
 • Buttons: Back / Next / Skip / Finish

⸻

⚙️ Technical Requirements
 • Use portal layer above canvas
 • Disable canvas interaction during tour
 • Pause drag events
 • Pause edge creation
 • Auto-scroll to element if needed
 • If sidebar collapsed → auto open
 • Handle dynamic canvas positions (nodes move)

Use data attributes like:

data-tour=“canvas”
data-tour=“add-card”
data-tour=“node”
data-tour=“edge”
data-tour=“settings-panel”
data-tour=“advanced-toggle”
data-tour=“save-button”

⸻

🚫 Avoid
 • Tooltip flickering
 • Layout shifting
 • Edge misalignment during highlight
 • Breaking drag logic
 • Re-rendering entire canvas

⸻

📦 Architecture

Tour steps must be JSON-driven:

const builderTourSteps = [
{
target: “canvas”,
title: “Workflow Canvas”,
description: “This is where you build your automation logic.”
},
…
]

So future edits don’t require rewriting logic.

⸻

🎯 Expected Result

User opens builder →
Screen dims →
Canvas highlighted →
Arrow + explanation →
User clicks Next →
Guided through full constructor →
After finish → never shows again unless replayed.
