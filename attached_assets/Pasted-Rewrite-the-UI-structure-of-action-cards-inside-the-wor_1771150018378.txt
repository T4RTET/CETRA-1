Rewrite the UI structure of action cards inside the workflow builder.

Do NOT ignore this.

Each action card must have TWO MODES:

👉 Basic Mode (default)
👉 Advanced Mode (expandable)

This is a structural UI change, not just adding fields.

⸻

CARD LAYOUT RULE

Every action card must show:

Header
Basic config
Advanced toggle button

Advanced settings are hidden by default.

The card must become visually smaller in basic mode.

⸻

BASIC MODE (visible by default)

Only show 4 controls:
 1. Account group selector
 2. URL / target link
 3. Delay before start
 4. Success behavior dropdown

That’s it.

No extra controls visible.

The goal is a clean minimal card.

⸻

ADVANCED MODE

Add a clear button inside card:

“Show advanced settings”

When clicked:

card expands vertically
smooth animation
reveals advanced panel

⸻

Advanced panel contains:

Target advanced

• concurrency slider
• execution order toggle

Timing advanced

• interval between accounts
• jitter/random delay %

Conditions

• skip flagged accounts toggle
• max retries input
• stop after failures input

Result handling

• branch on failure dropdown
• send to error queue toggle
• notify toggle

Diagnostics

• risk level selector (safe/medium/risky)
• resource estimate label
• inline mini logs

⸻

IMPORTANT UI RULES

Basic mode:

• compact
• beginner-friendly
• readable in 2 seconds

Advanced mode:

• collapsible section
• visually separated panel
• darker background block
• labeled “Advanced”

⸻

BEHAVIOR

When advanced closes:

values stay saved
only hidden visually

No data reset.

⸻

UX REQUIREMENTS

• smooth expand/collapse animation
• no layout jump
• neon hover glow
• consistent card width
• no overflow bugs

⸻

FINAL GOAL

Cards must feel like:

Beginner mode → simple
Advanced mode → powerful

NOT cluttered by default.

This is a UI restructuring task.

Do not ignore.
